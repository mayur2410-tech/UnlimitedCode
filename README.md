# 🚀 UnlimitedCode

## 📌 Overview
**UnlimitedCode** is a LeetCode-style coding platform where you only need to **implement the function logic**.  
No need to write boilerplate like `main()`, input parsing, or output formatting — the platform generates that automatically.  

Unlike existing platforms (like LeetCode), **UnlimitedCode gives you free and unlimited debugging runs**.  
No paywalls. No restrictions. Just focus on solving problems.

---

## 🎯 Why UnlimitedCode?
When practicing on platforms like LeetCode, you often hit restrictions:
- Limited debugging runs unless you pay for Premium.  
- Harder for beginners who just want to test and learn.  

**UnlimitedCode was built to fix that.**  
It provides a free, open environment where anyone can run and debug their solutions as many times as they want.

## ✨ Features
- 📝 Write only the **function logic** (no `main()`, no boilerplate).  
- 🔄 **Auto-generated driver code** handles input/output.  
- 💻 Multi-language support (C++, Python, Java planned).  
- 🧪 Run with **custom input** for debugging.  
- 🔒 Secure execution in a sandbox (Docker/Judge0).  
- 🚀 **Unlimited debugging runs** — no paywall.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Frontend:** React + Monaco Editor (VS Code’s editor)  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express (or Python FastAPI)  
- **Execution Engine:** Docker containers OR Judge0 API  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB (for problems & submissions)
